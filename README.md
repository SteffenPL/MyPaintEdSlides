# Draw your own presentations!

MyPaint is a great tool for digital drawing.
To my knowledge, there exists no tool so far, which automatically 
creates nice presentations out of MyPaint Layers.

# Usage

**If someone wants to use it, please write me a message and I will document the usage!**

In very, very short:
 1. use MyPaint to create the slides, save as `.ora` into one folder. The slides will appear in alphabetical order.
 2. copy the `demo` folder to a place which will later contain the final presentation. (We need the backgrounds and the reveal.js files)
 3. run ```python ora_interface.py "<input folder>" <output_folder>```

Now, the output folder contains the `index.html` which is the presentation.

# MyPaintEdSlides

*Currently the package is not final!*

We sketch the basic idea behind the presentation generator.

For a given .ora file, we extract all layers and
assemble slides according to the following rule.

Example:

000_title.ora:
- layer 0: name="background"
- layer 1
- layer 2
- layer 3

001_slide.ora:
- layer 0: name="background"
- layer 1
- group 1:
  - layer 2
  - group 2:
    - layer 3
  - layer 4
- layer 5


This would generate a HTML presentation with
two slides, containting the following content:

slide 0:
- subslide with layer 1
- subslide with layer 1,2
- subslide with layer 1,2,3

slide 1:
- subslide with layer 1
- subslide with layer 1,2 (enter group 1)
- subslide with layer 1,2,3 (enter group 2)
- subslide with layer 1,2,4 (leave group 2, still within group 1)
- subslide with layer 1,5 (leave group 1)

If wanted, the background could also be added, otherwise
a global background is used.

The HTML is based on reveal.js, this python script does only generate the body for the presentation
and composes the layers according to their groups.
