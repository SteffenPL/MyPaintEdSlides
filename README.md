# Draw your own presnetations!

MyPaint is a great tool for digital drawing.
To my knowledge, there exists no tool so far, which automatically 
creates nice presentations out of MyPaint Layers.

# MyPaintEdSlides

*Currently the package is not final!*

We sketch the basic idea behind the presentation generator.

For a given .ora file, we extract all layers and
assemble slides according to the following rule.

Example:

slides.ora:
- layer 0: name="background"
- layer 1: name="t"
- layer 2: name="a"
- layer 3: name="b:ta"
- layer 4: name="c:tb"

ref.ora
- layer 0: name="background"
- layer 1: name="a:\_"

This would generate a HTML presentation with
two slides, containting the following content:

slide 0:
- subslide 0: layer-{1,2,3}
- subslude 0: layer-{1,3,4}

slide 1:
- subslide 0: layer-{1}

If wanted, the background could also be added, otherwise
a global background is used.

The HTML is based on reveal.js, we only generate the body for the presentation.

# Current state

At the moment a generat interface is missing. Therefore it is not 
ready to be used without modifying the python code.

Anyway, the first presentation is already in work and "test\_ora\_presentation.py"
demonstrates some features.
